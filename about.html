    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Ahmad Beirami is a technologist passionate about building innovative, efficient, and scalable products. With over 15 years of experience in AI, more than 5 years of hands-on development of large language model (LLM) products at Google and Meta, and building an award-winning AI agent framework at Electronic Arts, he bridges deep technical expertise with real-world product impact. His recent work on LLM alignment advanced the Pareto frontier of Gemini model capabilities and earned an Outstanding Paper Award at ICLR 2025.</p>
    <h3>Selected Product Achievements</h3>
    <p>Ahmad Beirami has led dozens of product launches that span RL in games, integrity of video games, classifier fairness/robustness, and language model alignment/efficiency.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Google DeepMind: Created and launched <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12323">controlled decoding</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01234">InfAlign</a> for alignment of Google Gemini models that pushed up the Pareto frontier of model capabilities and inference-time compute scaling.</li>
      <li>Google Research: Created and launched <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09781">speculative decoding</a> solutions that made inference 2x faster from Gemini and Gemma models.</li>
      <li>Meta AI: Created and portotyped <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">CAIRaoke</a>, the first digital assistant agent with tool-use capabilities at Meta.</li>
      <li>Electronic Arts: Launched the first RL agents for pre-launch playtesting of EA games to find bugs and balance resources.</li>
    </ul>
